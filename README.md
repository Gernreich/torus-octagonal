# Octagonal torus — parametric, 90mm radius, 25 × 25mm cross-section

A laser-cut octagonal torus: two nested octagonal tubes joined by annular plates, leaving a
**square channel** all the way round. The cut file here is a 25 × 25mm channel with an outer
octagon of R 90 in 3mm Baltic birch plywood — but those are three numbers you choose, and everything else
derives from them, within one constraint. [Build it at your own size](#build-it-at-your-own-size).

**[Read the writeup](https://gernreich.github.io/octagonal-torus/)** — the trigonometry,
the generator settings, and how every number was verified against the cut files. Also
here as markdown: [`Octagonal_Torus_Gold.md`](Octagonal_Torus_Gold.md).

*Above, the cut file — colour is the cut order, not decoration. Below, two of the three
generator runs it was assembled from. Click any to download. The pictures are display
renderings with the stroke thickened; the real files draw 0.2646mm, which a browser shows
almost invisibly against a transparency checkerboard. Green, orange and cyan are darkened in the picture — at full strength they are too pale to read against a light ground. The cut file keeps the exact values.*

## Just cut it

**[`BuildA1_90_25.svg`](BuildA1_90_25.svg)** — the torus's 18 pieces plus 2 optional stiffening rings, 24 contours, verified.

| | |
|---|---|
| Material | 3mm Baltic birch ply |
| Kerf (`burn`) | 0.1mm |
| Sheet | 489 × 351mm |
| Pieces | 2 plates · 8 outer panels · 8 inner panels |
| Optional extras | 2 single-piece stiffening rings · 2 square patches for joining sliced sections |
| Result | 25.000mm radial × 25.000mm axial · 172.3 across flats · 110.3 bore |

Dry-fit one plate against one inner panel in cardboard before committing a sheet. The plate's tabs
around the hole should drop into the panel's notches.

**Cut everything except the violet.** Those 64 paths are the optional cuts — sixteen on each plate
and ring, each running straight from the hole edge to the rim. Take them and the torus comes apart
into sections, which is how you reach the simple trumpet, and the segments they define are the
patches for rejoining. Move them to a non-cutting layer or delete them first, or turn one green if
you do want it cut.

**Colour is the cut order: green → orange → cyan → black.** Eight panels and both patches are nested
inside the plate and ring holes, so they have to be cut before the hole that frees that waste; the
holes have to be cut before the rims that free the plates. Give all four a cutting operation and run them in that order.
`verify.js` checks the sequence and will tell you if it is wrong.

**Violet `#8000ff` is skip** — the 56 optional cuts described above, fourteen on each of the two
plates and two rings. Leave it unmapped or delete it. Blue does not appear at all: blue means
engrave across these repositories and never cuts.

The sequence is shared by every LaserMadeMusic repository — blue engraves, then
green → orange → cyan → black, with black always the cut that frees the part and violet always
skip. A file uses only the stages it needs.

**Two optional stiffening rings** sit on the lower half of the sheet — plain octagons, no joinery,
172.258mm across the flats with a 110.298mm hole, which is the finished torus's own outside and bore.
Lay one on a face and it sits flush at both edges, adding material without changing any dimension you
have to fit to. The torus closes without them; cut them if it needs stiffening.

3. **[Hole cutter, R 56.446](https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de/RegularBox?FingerJoint_style=rectangular&FingerJoint_surroundingspaces=1.0&FingerJoint_bottom_lip=0.0&FingerJoint_edge_width=1.0&FingerJoint_extra_length=0.0&FingerJoint_finger=2.0&FingerJoint_play=0.0&FingerJoint_space=2.0&FingerJoint_width=1.0&h=25&outside=0&radius_bottom=56.446&radius_top=56.446&n=8&top=closed&alignment_pins=1.0&bottom=closed&thickness=3.0&burn=0.1&format=svg&labels=0&labels=1&reference=100.0&tabs=0.0&qr_code=0&inner_corners=loop&spacing=0.5&debug=0&language=en&render=0)** — keep one disc, invert it, cut the hole in both outer discs

**Inverting the disc:** in Inkscape, break the octagon outline into its eight segments — one per
face — and flip each one. The flipped segments together are the hole; place them concentric on each
outer disc and cut. **The [video](https://www.youtube.com/@LaserMadeMusic) shows this step by step**, and
[the writeup](Octagonal_Torus_Gold.md#how-the-inversion-was-done) explains what flipping does to the
joint.

The eight segments in `BuildA1_90_25.svg` have been stitched into one closed loop per plate, but
that is **probably unnecessary** — the gaps between segments measured 0.077mm against a 0.1mm
kerf, so the cuts overlap anyway. It only matters if your laser software applies its own kerf
compensation, which needs closed paths — and if it does, switch it off, because `burn = 0.1` is
already baked into these files.

Run 3 uses a *smaller* radius on purpose: flipping shifts the band outward by one material
thickness. So you type the radius whose *apothem* is 3mm short of where the band should land —
3.247 smaller in radius, since 3mm of apothem is 3 × sec(22.5°) — and the inversion carries it
exactly into place. Details in Part 8a of the writeup.

The size relationship is fixed by one constant:

```
R_inner = R_outer − (ring + thickness) × sec(22.5°)
        = 90 − 28 × 1.082392 = 59.693
```

`sec(22.5°) = 1.0824` — an octagon's corners sit 8.24 % further out than its flats.

**The three numbers are not independent.** The ring and both walls have to fit inside the outer
octagon, which puts a floor under the radius:

```
R_outer  >  (ring + 2 × thickness) × sec(180°/n)
```

For a 25mm ring in 3mm that floor is 33.554mm, so R 90 is comfortably clear. Below it the hole
cutter comes out zero or negative and there is no bore at all — ask for a 500mm ring at R 10 and
the arithmetic has nowhere to put it. `torus-geometry-diagram.js` checks this before it draws
anything and refuses, naming the minimum for your ring and thickness.

## Check your own file

```
node verify.js BuildA1_90_25.svg RunA2_R59Point693.svg
```

Reports the stroke palette, contours, plate and hole geometry, hole concentricity, **joint phase**,
**cut order**, nesting clearances, and whether everything sits inside the viewBox. The phase check
is the one that matters — it catches a hole whose tabs land where the panel is solid, which is a
build that measures perfectly and cannot be assembled.

```
node torus-geometry-diagram.js 90 25 3        # redraw the figure at any size
```

## What else is here

`RunA1/2/3` are the three generator outputs from the links above, unmodified. Run 2 doubles as the
reference `verify.js` checks joint phase against, so keep it if you plan to verify your own files.
